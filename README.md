## Motivation

The __creative writing__ is an extended hobby around the world. There is a lot of people who do it not in a professional way, but as an entertainment to spend its free time with. However, that does not means that this people doesn’t have a great talent. Actually, a lot of them are really good writers and have amazing stories to talk about. Because that, __we did identify the necessity__ to provide to them an easy and enjoyable platform that does solve any lack of feedback that there could be, and a customizable way to efficiently organize the creative projects that they are developing. All of this, as a reinforcement of its creative writing skills in a great __worldbuilding__ community.

### Direct roles 
Also, it is required to point out that there are not a single roll in the __worldbuilding__ scenario. To be precise, we have to  understand that the __worldbuilding__ is a _creative framework_ that encompasses, at least, three roles:

| id | Role name | description |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| **Wr** |`writer`| the one who enjoy writing and knows how to convert an idea, to a readable story |
| **Ar** |`architect`|  the one who designs the world and knows/thinks the rules that govern it |
| **Ch** |`chaotic entity`|the one who make things happen there|

### Indirect roles
Finally, a latest role that is out of the __worldbuilding__, but does interact with it too, is the `reader`.

| id | Role name | description |
|:-:|:-:|:-|
| **Rd** |`reader`| It doesn’t only enjoys about the previous roles work, but is the one in charge to give them feedback about its observations and, under its canons and reading experience, ensure the story gives its best. |
